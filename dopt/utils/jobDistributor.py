A job distributor class, that maintains a list of available machines,
and distributes jobs to them. My idea is that someone uses this by
generating their own command lines, like 'echo hello; cd ~/teaching; ls'
and this class basically makes the system call
'ssh host command'.  It's the caller's responsibility to generate
appropriate command lines, redirecting output as they see fit.

uses subprocess to do this, instantiating a process to execute the
ssh command.  Process information is then stored in a Job object,
which can in turn be queried.

This class should be instantiated by an independent thread, which
periodically checks for the completion of jobs and maintains a job
queue.  See submitMaster and testSubmitMaster for guidance. When
presented with a job to distribute when all hosts are busy to their
capacity, this code will hang, waiting for a spot to open up.  It's
someone else's responsibility to keep the original caller informed
about the submissions made--again, see submitMaster.
