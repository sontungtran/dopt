This script tests the submitMaster and the JobDistributor. 
I'm going to ask for the execution of testScript, which is a
unix shell script that resolves the hostname and stuff like 
that, make sure we have everything working. 
[you@somewhere distributedPythonCode]$ python testSubmitMaster.py

Get current dir, so we can we can cd to that in our command.

our responsibility to generate the line as it should be executed
