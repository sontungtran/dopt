#Proof of concept script.
#This simple script resolves hostname and time and accepts information
#about the test it's running, echoing the information.  This is called
#by testSubmitMaster.py, which generates many calls of this script 
#with different procID sent in, for execution on machines accessible 
#through ssh.


procID=$1
#outputFile=$2
#This may well be the interesting way to set
#parameters for the particular run.
hostn=`hostname`
curTime=`date`
echo `whoami` on host $hostn
echo `host $hostn`
echo executing process: $procID
echo time: $curTime
